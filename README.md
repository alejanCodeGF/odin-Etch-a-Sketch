# Etch-a-Sketch

![alt text](images/Screenshot_Etch_a_Sketch.png)

This project is a web-based version of the Etch A Sketch game. It is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is fully functional, and it allows users to draw and create their own designs.

## Features

The game has a n x n grid of squares (n between 1 and 100, as you need)
Users can draw lines by moving the cursor over the grid
4 different colors
Users can clear the screen by clicking the "Clear" button

## Future updates

1. Raimbow color, which randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
2. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
